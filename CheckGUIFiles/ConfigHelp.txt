                                                                                                                           When your printer script is called, this application sends a numeric argument depending on your selections. 
('1' for EB Printer Check, '2' for FAB Printer Check. If a 
specific printer is being tested, two arguments are sent: a 
numeric '3' followed by a string, the printer name  specified. For proper functioning, ensure that your script is able to handle these arguments and respond appropriately.    
                                                                                                   When your runaway check script is called, no arguments are  sent to the script. Simply ensure that script output is sent to standard out.
